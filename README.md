My program uses python3.
To run it on campus machines, use the command:
    python3 puzzle.py <PuzzlePath>

It will output debbugging information regarding the algorithm's current depth 
in the search tree and the original state of the game. Just ignore this.

The last piece of information the program outputs is the path to the 
solution file.

Solutions are output to a file path that is similar to the input file path, 
but output files will end in "_sol.txt".
